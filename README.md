## About
This project is a demonstration of a simple Node REST API. It in turn uses the GitHub REST API.

## Linting
This project uses [Google GTS](https://github.com/google/gts) for linting. Review the `package.json` file to see scripts for linting. If I were onboarding other developers for this project, I would recommend installing relevant editor plugins (such as Typescript and ESLint plugins for VSCode).
